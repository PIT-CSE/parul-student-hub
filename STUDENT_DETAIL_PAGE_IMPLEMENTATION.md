## Technical Implementation
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Next.js 13+ app router with dynamic routes
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MongoDB/Mongoose for data persistence
- NextAuth.js for authentication

## File Changes
1. `/src/app/student/[ugNumber]/page.js` - Main student detail page
2. `/src/app/api/students/[ugNumber]/route.js` - API endpoint for updates
3. `/src/models/Student.js` - Student data model (previously updated)

## Usage
1. Navigate to `/student/[ugNumber]` to view a student's profile
2. Admin users see an "Edit Student" button in the header
3. Click edit to enable inline editing of all fields
4. Use Save/Cancel buttons to commit or discard changes
5. Error messages display if validation fails

The implementation provides a comprehensive student information management system with proper security, validation, and user experience considerations.
